# Installation
This code reads the images with the command imread(Which is written inside of it). Thus you need to change it with every image you need to use filter on it.

# License
Matlab

There are five variables at the beginning of the code file. To get more satisfying results, you should change these variables with every different image.

Results of this filter is provided in the results.pdf file. Also you can see effect of this five variables in this pdf file. (see https://github.com/CemalUnal/XDoG-Filter/blob/master/results/results.pdf)
